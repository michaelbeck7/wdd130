        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Think about how you keep track of all your recipes right now: is it a cookbook stored
            away somewhere? An overflowing folder that you have to dig through every time a holiday
            comes around and you need? What if you could access all of your recipes in one place from
            your phone, or computer. That’s what my website would be: a single place to store all my
            recipes whether you're grocery shopping, cooking, or planning my meals for the week.</p>
        <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The members of the target audience of this website are busy college students looking for easy recipes. They
            are people who
            enjoy cooking. Because they are busy and looking to maximize every minute, they expect a site that is
            simple, clean, and presents recipes without extra fluff. Becaues our audience will be using both phones and
            laptops, the website must be responsive and easy to navigate on both mobile and desktop.</p>

        <h3>Shopping Tips</h3>
        <p>
            Moving away from home and starting college comes with a host of new responsibilities. Along with attending
            classes, studying, completing assignments, and washing laundry, one new responsibility can be especially
            daunting: cooking meals. Students must learn how to plan nutritious and satisfying meals for their week, and
            how to stock their shelves on a budget. Here are some tips to get you started.
            Meal prep during the weekend to save time during the rest of the week. Find a meal that will be enjoyable
            enough to eat all week, and cook up enough to pack in the fridge or freezer for quick reheating later. This
            practice will give more time for studying during the week and decreases the temptation to spend more money
            eating out. One good option for meal prep is rice/protein/veggies. Take your pick of white rice or brown
            rice. Then, cook up your favorite protein. Some options include chicken, beef, or beans if you prefer
            vegetarian. Then finish it off with your choice of veggies. Microwave-able steamed frozen vegetables such as
            broccoli or mixed vegetables are a convenient way to go. Top it off with your favorite sauce, pack it up in
            the fridge, and you’ll be set for the rest of the week.
